# The following script will control the Dream Cheeky Storm & Thunder USB
# Missile Launchers.  There are a few projects for using older launchers
# in Linux, but I couldn't find any for this launcher, so... enjoy.

# Thunder: http://www.dreamcheeky.com/thunder-missile-launcher
# O.I.C Storm: http://www.dreamcheeky.com/storm-oic-missile-launcher

# This script requires:
# * PyUSB 1.0+, apt in Debian/Ubuntu installs 0.4.
# Also, unless you want to toggle with udev rules, it needs to be run as root
